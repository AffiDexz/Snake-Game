# Snake-Game
A classic Snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project recreates the nostalgic experience of the original Snake game with a modern and responsive design. The game is easy to play, and the code is simple to understand and modify, making it a great project for learning and experimenting with web development concepts.
